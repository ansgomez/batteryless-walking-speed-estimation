### Software

The code in this repository was developed by Thomas Schalch (Master Thesis).

- MSP430: The code relevant to the MSP430-based prototype that acquired and stored images.

- MSP432: The code releavant to the MSP432-based prototype that acquired and processed images to determine the user's walking speed.

- Matlab: Code used to develop and test the optical-flow algorithm using a custom dataset.

- Python: Utility code used to extract images from prototypes.

### Hardware

The hardware in this repository was designed by Thomas Schalch (Master Thesis).

- Schematics for the MSP432-based demo board and prototype.
