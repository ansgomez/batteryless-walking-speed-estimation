===== Image Processing =====

Block Matching: 	48.84 ms (measured, compiler:optimized)

===== 10 bit implementation =====
Clock Frequency: 48 MHz
Dividers for Timers and ADC: 6		-> 48 MHz / 6 = 8 MHz
-> ADC_TIMER_CYCLES = 17		-> Acquisition of one pixel: 17/8MHz = 2.125 Âµs
-> 112*112 pixels			-> Acquisition of one image: 26.7 ms	~ 37 images per second
